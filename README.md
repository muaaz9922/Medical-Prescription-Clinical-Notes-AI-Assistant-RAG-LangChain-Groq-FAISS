## ⚙️ Tech Stack
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **LangChain** | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for context-aware responses |
| ⚡ **Groq API** | Lightning-fast LLM inference and reasoning |
| 🧩 **FAISS** | Vector database for medical text retrieval and similarity search |
| 🩺 **spaCy** | Named Entity Recognition (NER) for drugs, dosages, and medical conditions |
| 📊 **Plotly + WordCloud** | Interactive data visualization and keyword frequency insights |
| 🧾 **pdfplumber + pytesseract** | Extracts text from medical PDFs and scanned prescriptions |

---

## 🧩 Features
✅ Reads **handwritten or digital prescriptions**  
✅ Extracts **drug names, dosage, and frequency**  
✅ Simplifies **medical terms into plain language**  
✅ Highlights **potential warnings and interactions**  
✅ Generates **interactive charts and word clouds**  
✅ Compatible with **Kaggle, Jupyter, or Colab**  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Upload your **medical prescription** (PDF or image).  
2. The system uses **pdfplumber** or **pytesseract** to extract text.  
3. **spaCy** identifies key medical entities (drugs, conditions, dosages).  
4. Text is vectorized via **FAISS** for fast retrieval.  
5. **LangChain + Groq API** generate context-rich explanations and summaries.  
6. Visualization modules display the most frequent terms and relationships.
